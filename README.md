## How does it work

weebTools works by downloading image from url copied to clipboard and saving it's tags to a local database.

## Supported sites

- [Safebooru](https://safebooru.donmai.us) (danbooru too!)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com) (only with bundled Tampermonkey script)
- [Pixiv](https://pixiv.net) (only with bundled Tampermonkey script)

## Why do I need scripts?

Twitter doesn't really have a tag system, and Pixiv's isn't as good as I would like it to be.
My scripts work by letting the user select from a list of tags and copies in this format:

```
http://path/to/post|http://direct/path/to/image|Tags: tag1, tag2
```
